# Galaxy Image Classification Through Computer Vision

The purpose of the project was to utilize computer vision techniques such as Inception V3 and Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) for transfer learning to obtain a highly accurate model that could predict the classifications of galaxy images. Following data
preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and feature extraction, the model achieved proved to be successful with accuracy rates
ranging from the high 80th to low 90th percentiles on tested images.

The dataset is sourced from NASAâ€™s Sloan Digital Sky Survey and GalaxyZoo. The Sloan data consists of 61,578 images of galaxies and are sized 400 by 400 pixels. The GalaxyZoo data is a csv file of
classifications of each Sloan image based on the responses of tens of thousands of GalaxyZoo users. Users answered questions on the shape of each galaxy and then answered questions depending on the
responses to previous questions.
